# femar-tv
This is an old React Native project for IPTV (actually it's published on the Android Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oscaralderete.femar_tv)

Originally published in 2021, it had a last update on September 29, 2022. So it's code needs an upgrade.

If you don't know how to upgrade an old project, just run next commands on your terminal:

```
npx npm-check-updates -u
yarn install
```

As far I know if you don't have installed Yarn (I do), then you need to install the project dependencies using:

```
npm install
```

I'll prepare a video to explain this, so you can get a useful + updated code that could be useful for your own purposes.
